It involves episodes of high energy and euphoria (mania) as well as episodes of low mood and sadness (depression). People with bipolar disorder may experience changes in sleep, energy levels, and behavior. Treatment usually involves medication and therapy to help manage symptoms and stabilize mood."

    - text: "Bipolar disorder diagnosis involves a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional. 
            They assess symptoms, medical history, and family history. 
            Diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5 are used to determine if symptoms align with bipolar disorder. 
            Mood patterns, medical evaluations, psychosocial factors, and collateral information are considered. 
            An accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Seeking professional help is recommended for those suspecting bipolar disorder."

            Medication helps stabilize mood, therapy aids in understanding and managing symptoms, and lifestyle changes include maintaining a routine, reducing stress, and seeking support. 
            Close collaboration with healthcare professionals is essential for developing a personalized treatment plan."
