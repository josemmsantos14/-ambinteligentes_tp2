  utter_bipolar_diagnosis:
    - text: "Bipolar disorder diagnosis involves a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional. 
            They assess symptoms, medical history, and family history. 
            Diagnostic criteria from the DSM-5 are used to determine if symptoms align with bipolar disorder. 
            Mood patterns, medical evaluations, psychosocial factors, and collateral information are considered. 
            An accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Seeking professional help is recommended for those suspecting bipolar disorder."

            Close collaboration with healthcare professionals is essential for developing a personalized treatment plan."
