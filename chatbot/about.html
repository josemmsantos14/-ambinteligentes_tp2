      <h4>What is mental health?</h4>
      <p>
        Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social
        well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps
        determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy
        choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from
        childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Why is mental health important for overall health?</h4>
      <p>
        Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall
        health. For example, depression increases the risk for many types of
        physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like
        diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic
        conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>Can your mental health change over time?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change
        over time, depending on many factors. When the demands placed on a
        person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health
        could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, caring
        for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience
        poor mental health.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>What causes mental illness?</h4>
      <p>
        There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can
        contribute to risk for mental illness, such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet causes" style="list-style-type: circle !important">
        <li>
          Adverse Childhood Experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse
          (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions,
          such as cancer or diabetes
        </li>
        <li>Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain</li>
        <li>Use of alcohol or drugs</li>
        <li>Having feelings of loneliness or isolation</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Path to improved health</h4>
      <ul class="bullet treatment">
        <li>
          <b>Psychotherapy or counseling</b> - This also is called talk therapy.
          It is one of the most common treatments for mental health disorders.
          It involves talking about your problems with a mental health
          professional but is so much more. The is an education element, a focus
          on relaxation exercises and coping skills as well as stress
          management. There are many types of talk therapy. Some common ones
          include cognitive behavioral therapy or dialectical behavior therapy.
          Talk therapy is often done one-on-one. It can also be done in a group
          setting or with your family. Individual and group talk therapy is
          sometimes helpful. This type of therapy can be useful even for those
          who do not have a mental health condition and are simply going through
          challenging life situations (grief, divorce, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Prescription medicine</b> - Prescription medicine is another
          popular treatment method. Medicines for mental disorders make changes
          to brain chemicals that are involved in emotions and thought patterns.
          Medicines don’t cure psychiatric conditions or health problems. But
          they can improve your symptoms. They can make other treatments, such
          as counseling, more effective. There are many kinds of prescription
          medicines available that work in different ways. Your doctor will make
          a recommendation and share any side effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Support groups</b> - Self-help and support groups can help you gain
          insight into your condition. They can provide friendships, support,
          resources, and tips on how to live with your condition. They also help
          address the feelings of isolation that often go along with mental
          health conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Other therapies</b> - There are many types of therapies people use
          to help treat mental health problems. These can include physical
          activity, such as exercise or yoga. They can also include creative
          therapies. These are therapies done using means of expressing yourself
          creatively. They can include using art, music, movement, or writing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ECT or other brain stimulation therapy</b> - Electroconvulsive
          therapy (ECT) is a safe procedure that sends electric currents into
          the brain. This causes changes in the brain that can improve and even
          reverse troubling symptoms. ECT and other brain stimulation therapies
          are often used when other kinds of treatment haven’t worked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy</b> -
          This type of therapy is used to relieve psychological stress. It has
          become an effective way to help treat trauma, especially
          post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hospital or residential treatment program</b> - Sometimes your
          mental health issues become so bad that you need to receive treatment
          in a hospital or a long-term program. This can happen when you can’t
          take care of yourself. Or it happens when you are in danger of harming
          yourself or others.
